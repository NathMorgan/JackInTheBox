<h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
<p>
    Founded in July 2012 Jack in the Box CIC (Community Interest Company) was extablished as a social enterprise company aiming to generate our own income which will be reinvested in our social mission to create opportunities,
    develop existing provisions and inspire individuals to engage in a variety of activities organised by us. <br/> <br/>
    Our aim is to aid in the social, emotional and physical development of children, young people and adults with disabilities or additional needs,
    those who are disengaged and those who have suffered from abuse or neglect. Our services include support for siblings and families of anybody vulnerable
</p>
<p>
    Our programmes and activities are inspired by the individuals and families who access this provision.
    We pride ourselves on offering families across the Tees Valley a place to take their children where the activities are fun,
    and the environment is friendly and safe.
    All Jack in the Box staff are CRB qualified and have a wealth of experience working with all ages and abilities.
